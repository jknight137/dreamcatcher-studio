# **App Name**: GoalFlow

## Core Features:

- AI Goal Decomposition: Use LLMs to decompose user-defined goals into actionable tasks based on SMART criteria, Eisenhower Matrix, and the Pareto Principle.
- Voice Input: Enable voice input for hands-free goal setting and task creation.
- Intelligent Task Prioritization: Automatically prioritize tasks based on urgency, importance, and impact, using a Pareto-inspired scoring system. Use the AI as a tool to re-prioritize tasks when needed.
- Intuitive Task UI: Display tasks in an intuitive UI, organized by Eisenhower Matrix quadrants, with a prioritized "Suggested Tasks" list. Use Bootstrap for layout and components.
- Progress Tracking and Reporting: Provide weekly check-ins and customizable reports to track progress and identify overdue tasks.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Calm blue (#3498db) for focus and productivity.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#f4f4f4) for backgrounds and content separation.
- Accent: Green (#2ecc71) for task completion and positive feedback.
- Highlight color: Yellow (#f1c40f) to highlight important and urgent tasks.
- Clean and readable sans-serif fonts for optimal readability.
- Simple and consistent icons to represent task categories and actions.
- Clear and structured layout with Eisenhower Matrix quadrants prominently displayed.
- Subtle animations for task transitions and progress updates.

## Original User Request:
Design and implement a productivity web application named "Dreamcatcher" with the following specifications:
Purpose
"Dreamcatcher" is a productivity tool that empowers users to manage tasks and achieve goals efficiently. It leverages AI to break down user-defined goals into actionable tasks, prioritizes them using proven methodologies, and offers a hands-free voice input option. The app provides a simple, intuitive interface, progress tracking through reports and check-ins, and seamless access across desktop and mobile devices.
Core Features
Goal Decomposition

Implement an AI-driven system that interprets user goals and decomposes them into actionable tasks.
Use the SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound), Eisenhower Matrix (urgency vs. importance), and Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) to structure and prioritize tasks.
Integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) via the OpenAI API to process natural language inputs and generate task breakdowns.

Voice Input Integration

Enable users to input goals using voice commands, supported by accurate speech recognition.
Ensure the app accesses the device’s microphone, with compatibility across platforms (desktop and mobile).

Task Prioritization

Automatically prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance, combining Eisenhower Matrix categorization with a Pareto-inspired scoring system (e.g., (impact * importance_weight) / days_until_due).
Highlight high-impact tasks to keep users focused on what matters most.

User Interface

Design a simple, intuitive UI using Bootstrap for task creation, editing, deletion, and completion tracking.
Display tasks in Eisenhower Matrix quadrants and provide a "Suggested Tasks" list based on priority scores.

Reports and Check-ins

Offer weekly check-ins showing completed tasks, overdue items, and upcoming priorities.
Provide customizable reports for progress tracking over user-defined date ranges.

Cross-Platform Accessibility

Develop as a PWA for seamless use on desktops and mobile devices, requiring only one codebase.
Include web push notifications (via OneSignal) and offline functionality through a service worker.
Additional Requirements
Microphone Access

Ensure robust, platform-compatible microphone access for voice input, adhering to browser standards (e.g., Web Speech API).

Long-Term Support

Architect the app with scalability and maintainability in mind, using modular code and a flexible database schema to support future enhancements (e.g., new AI features or native apps).

AI Integration

Leverage LLMs to interpret voice and text inputs, ensuring task breakdowns align with SMART, Eisenhower, and Pareto principles.
Optimize API calls for cost-effectiveness and performance.

Privacy and Security Thoughts

Secure user data (especially voice inputs and goals) with hashed passwords (via werkzeug.security), encrypted storage, and HTTPS.
Implement user authentication (via Flask-Login) to protect accounts.
Deployment
Deploy on cloud prioritizing cost-effectiveness and scalability.

Database Schema Example (open for improvement)
Users: id (TEXT PK), name (TEXT), password (TEXT)
Tasks: id (SERIAL PK), title (TEXT), urgency (TEXT), importance (TEXT), due_date (DATE), impact (INTEGER), completed (BOOLEAN), user_id (TEXT FK), created_at (TIMESTAMP)
Example Workflow
User says, “I want to launch a blog next month.”
Voice input is transcribed and sent to the OpenAI API.
AI generates tasks (e.g., "Choose a platform," "Write first post") with SMART attributes, assigns Eisenhower categories, and scores them using Pareto logic.
Tasks appear in the UI, prioritized and ready for action.
